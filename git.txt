do git push origin master

git branch -- to list all the branchess
git checkout branchname  -- to switch to specific branch

git branch branchname -- this command will create the new branch

how to merge with master
1. git checkout master
2. git pull origin master  -- may be somebody changed into master origin at github.

git fetch origin

git branch --delete Ram
git branch -D Ram

git checkout filename  -- if file is delete, but you already commited it before deleting it, then fire the command you will get it back.
git checkout -f -- it will do all the files.
git diff -- it will compare working area with staging area.

and once you have done git add -A --then there will be no difference, since file is staged and ready to commi

git diff --stage
git commit -a -m "add"

by mistake if you have added any files to staging area, but now you want to remove it from staging, so that it cannot be pushed remote.

git rm --cached filename

git status -s -- it will tell you , what is modified, GREEN M will show modified in staging area, RED M will show modified in working area.
